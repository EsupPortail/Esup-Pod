# Introduction

Created in 2014 at the university of [Lille](https://www.univ-lille.fr/),
the POD project has been managed by the
[Esup Portail consortium](https://www.esup-portail.org/)
and supported by the [Ministry of Higher Education and Research](http://www.enseignementsup-recherche.gouv.fr/)
since September 2015.

The project and the platform of the same name are aimed at users of our institutions,
by allowing the publication of videos in the fields of research
(promotion of platforms, etc.), training (tutorials, distance training, student reports, etc.),
institutional life (video of events), offering several days of content.
