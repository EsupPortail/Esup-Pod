"""This command is useful to check the directory DEFAULT_RECORDER_PATH,
and its subdirectories, if they contain videos that were published by
recorders. The idea is to have one directory for each recorder. Example : at
the Montpellier university, there is one Multicam recorder for Polytech. In
settings, we have : - DEFAULT_RECORDER_PATH (in settings_local.py) =
/data/www/%userpod%/media/uploads/ - in Pod database(cf. Pod
administration), recorder_recorder table : a line for the Polytech Multicam
recorder, with value 'polytech' for 'directory' property - FTP Directory (
directly on the recorder settings) :
/data/www/%userpod%/media/uploads/polytech or empty (depends on vsftpd
config) So, the recorder makes a publication, via FTP, on the directory
/data/www/%userpod%/media/uploads/polytech and this script checks regularly
this directory. When video files are published, an email is  sent to
recorder's manager (cf. Pod administration), with a publication link. To
have more details, see online documentation.

This script must be executed regurlaly (for an example, with a CRON task).
Example : crontab -e */15 * * * * /usr/bin/bash -c 'export
WORKON_HOME=/data/www/%userpod%/.virtualenvs; export
VIRTUALENVWRAPPER_PYTHON=/usr/bin/python3.6; cd
/data/www/%userpod%/django_projects/podv2; source
/usr/bin/virtualenvwrapper.sh; workon django_pod; python manage.py recorder
